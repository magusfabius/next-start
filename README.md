# NextJs Starter Template

🚧 work in progress 🚧

This is a starter template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
I will use it as a personal blog and playground to make some experiments. 🧪 

Plus:
1. Added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) support and configuration (tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js)
2. Made a call to Opensea to fetch collections and render their images using __SWR__ (endorfine.js)
3. Developing a Tinder-like Swiper component using [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) (components/swiper/swiper.js)
4. Check the /api/quotes to read my favourite quotes!

🎯 Next steps:
1. Web 3.0 implementation
2. Web 2.0 auth
3. Test some databases with GraphQL


Let's start with __npm install__ !

Deployed with Vercel, it's online, [check it out](https://next-start-five.vercel.app/) !
